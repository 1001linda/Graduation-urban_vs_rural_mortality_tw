# Exploring Mortality Trends in Urban and Non-Urban Taiwan Using the Lee-Carter Model
## Project Overview
This project applies the **Lee-Carter model** to analyze and compare **mortality trends** and improvements between **urban areas** (Taichung City, Kaohsiung City) and **non-urban areas** (Nantou County, Pingtung County) in central and southern Taiwan.

The study utilizes mortality data from **2008 to 2022**, dividing the period into two phases: 2008â€“2015 and 2016â€“2022, to explore regional and temporal differences in mortality patterns. The analysis considers both **gender and age**, focusing on parameter estimates to reveal trends and regional disparities in age-specific mortality improvements.
